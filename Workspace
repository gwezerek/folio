##Fake deep-linking
Open story
Change hash
On load check hash, open, load, scrollto

## Real
Container categories
Onclick small loads in posts
Onclick large links out

## Semi Deep Linking
Homepage works as now
At large categories link out


## Fake Deep Linking
Load the same page at all widths
Parse URL on load
Open correct content

To do: 
- [ ] Show only one category at once
- [ ] Make final post in category open next category
- [ ] Make final post in final category open first category
- [ ] If nothing open, show grid 
- [ ] Add grid links to posts 
- [ ] Make posts have the same layout as index
- [ ] If open, hide unopened categories at large
- [ ] Parse URL to open correct post
- [ ] Scroll to that correct post if at small
- [ ] Profit


## Show only one category at once

Create post expand and post collapse functions
On expand, find first category with active class, run post collapse
	Add active class to selected category


Thoughts
User module pattern for overall functions
Use constructor to create category object to hold current post
Need to combine constructor with module

For cats.length create new Cat
