client: Upstatement
story: Upstatement works with publications large and small. For clients such as Business Today and The Daily Princetonian, editors receive a custom Wordpress install called Inkwell. I designed and built an admin tool for editors to move stories around on their site's pages. One way editors can reorder stories is by dragging and dropping.
