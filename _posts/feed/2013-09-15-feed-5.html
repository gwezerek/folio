client: Upstatement
story: Upstatement works with publications large and small. For clients such as Business Today and The Daily Princetonian, editors receive a custom Wordpress install called Inkwell. I designed and built an admin tool for editors to move stories around on their site's pages. One way editors can move those stories is through dragging and dropping, provided by jQuery UI.
