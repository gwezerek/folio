story: I had another chance to work with Derek when we ran a piece in the tablet edition about Haviland Tuf, a grumpy, cat-loving space explorer from George R. R. Martin's earlier novels. There weren't many depictions of Tuf in existence, so we had a great time letting our minds run wild. For the piece above, about Yojimbo's prototypical antihero, I animated the samurai slicing up a piece of page furniture.
