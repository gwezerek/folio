story: I was the lead designer for Wired's Play section, our pop culture department. Each month we chose a theme to connect the section's stories. For the "quests" issue, we ran a choose-your-own-history of the Choose Your Own Adventure series. I commissioned Derek Stenning, a concept artist who had never worked for Wired before, to illustrate our protaganist's harried choice between Door A and Door B.
