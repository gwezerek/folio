story: I was the lead designer for Wired&rsquo;s Play section, our pop culture department. Each month we chose a theme to connect the section&rsquo;s stories. For the &ldquo;quests&rdquo; issue, we ran a choose-your-own-history of the Choose Your Own Adventure series. I commissioned Derek Stenning, a concept artist who had never worked for Wired before, to illustrate our protaganist&rsquo;s harried choice between Door A and Door B.
