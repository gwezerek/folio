story: My primary role at Wired was lead designer on Play, the magazine's pop culture department. In addition, each month had a theme which connected all of the stories. For the "quests" issue, we ran a history of the Choose Your Own Adventure series that mirrored the novels' format. I commissioned Derek Stenning, a concept artist who had never worked for Wired before, to illustrate our protaganist choosing between two doors as a squid attacks from the bottom of the layout.
