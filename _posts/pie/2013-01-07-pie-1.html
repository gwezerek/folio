category : Pie Chart Reductions
client: Wired
story: For Wired&rsquo;s 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary issue, the editors commissioned a full-page pie chart about TED talks. After checking to make sure the format made sense (parts comprised a meaningful whole, plenty of space to make sure smaller slices didn&rsquo;t disappear), I pumped out a number of options to help the chart hold the page. We ran this one.
