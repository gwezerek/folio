story: What would the future of spring cleaning look like? We figured Dyson would dominate the market, so I created a sleek, self-contained vortex that would suck up all the dirt in a room. For the box art I used Cinema 4D to render the vacuum and Illustrator to create custom lettering in the style of Dyson's branding (their typeface isn't available for purchase).
