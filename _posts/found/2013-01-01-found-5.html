story: I was the final designer at Wired to work on Found, the magazine's closing page. Each month we collaborated with readers to imagine the future of a certain slice of life. The page's budget was very small, so I illustrated and Photoshopped most of the pages myself. For the future of brain surgery, we riffed off the NY subway's Dr. Zizmor ads. Instead of clear skin, our doc promised cognitive recalibration via optogenetics.
