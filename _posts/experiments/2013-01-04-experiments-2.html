story: Right before I left Wired, I was asked to help art direct "The Connective," a 48-hour tablet magazine project. The issue focused on the ways we interact with machines, and the way machines interact with each other. During the first few hours, while we were waiting for content to come in, I drafted this logo idea in Processing and After Effects.
