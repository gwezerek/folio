story: Shortly before I left Wired, I was asked to help art direct The Connective, a 48-hour tablet magazine project. The issue focused on the ways we interact with machines, and the way machines interact with each other. I drafted this logo idea in Processing and After Effects while we were waiting for content to come in.
