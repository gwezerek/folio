story: Before I interned at Upstatement, I applied for a job there. Candidates had a week to redesign one of four provided articles. My first serious web project, after four or five all-nighters I sumbitted a responsive design with inline annotations and a basic image slider. I didn't get the job, but I did earn a final interview.
