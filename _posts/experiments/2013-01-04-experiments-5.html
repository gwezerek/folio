story: Before I interned at Upstatement, I applied for a job there. Candidates had a week to choose one of four articles and design a feature article to suit the article. My first serious web project, after four or five all-nighters I sumbitted a responsive design with annotations and a basic image slider. I didn't get the job, but I did get make it to the final interview round.
