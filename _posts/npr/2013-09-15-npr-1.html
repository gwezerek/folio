story: Upstatement's background creating responsive news sites was certainly one of the reasons NPR decided to work with us. We ensured mobile users received the same content at a fraction of the desktop page load. I took lead on designing the site's smaller widths and wrote a function to resize and serve appropriate images to mobile users, as well as higher resolution images to those with HiDPI devices.
